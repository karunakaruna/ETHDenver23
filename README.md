### Context

The ‘Metaverse’ as it exist now is comprised of a vast field of disconnected spaces and platforms. Web-based metaverse platforms offer the greatest accessibility and possibility for cross-platform travel, through links and portals. Platforms like Monaverse, Hyperfy, Spatial, Decentraland, OnCyber and Voxels give us a glimpse of the potential contained in these worlds.

### Problem

These spaces and platforms remain disconnected, fragmented, difficult to navigate between. There exists few solutions to aid Metaverse explorers in the mapping and navigation of this un-defined space.

### Compass

Compass is a meta-ui, chrome extension and mapping tool. It gives web-based metaverse explorers an easy and intuitive way to navigate, map, and save their travels through the metaverse - then share their curated experiences with others.

## Features


-Cross-metaverse meta-ui chrome-extension provides a navigation layer by saving the url of the current tab and allowing url recall through the 3d interface.
-Save your favorite locations on an engaging, navigable 3d-map using ComposeDB
-Drag, organize and customize your own map. Create landmarks and connections that help create concrete structures.

-Curate your maps, save them - and share with your connections.
-View real-time presence of network on shared map interface. 

This code was adapted a chrome-extension boiler-plate by Michael Xieyang Liu | [Website](https://lxieyang.github.io)

## Planned implementations
-Interactive react-three-fiber scene with url/name and coordinate saving.
	See code snippets.txt
-Metamask login.
-Saving and loading maps from ComposeDB.
-Syncing live network presence with Lens Protocol and Websockets.
